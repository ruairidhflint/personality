What is the flow?

Show spinner on loading screen - parse ID from URL
Send to database and check to see if a record exists for that user
If no - continue - if yes, display a page preventing them from doing anything

Store the userID in state - go through the whole process....on the final screen, submit to an
endpoint that saves the data
